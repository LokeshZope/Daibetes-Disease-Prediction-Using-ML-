# Daibetes Disease Prediction Using ML 
 By analysing the data the diabetes prediction is done with the help of ML algorithms
 The application data is used to evaluate whether the patient has diabetes or not
 Steps Followed:

1. Importing of the data.
2. Checking for null values(if there any) and data types(if all are same or not).
3. Visualization of null values by using heat map.
4. Data Visualization by using various graphs.
5. Checking the correlation between all the attributes present.
6. Splitting the data using test-train split.
7. Applyiing various machine learning algorithms on the data.
8. Comparisons of the accuracy scores
9. Performing hyperparameter tuning to increase the accuracy of the model.
